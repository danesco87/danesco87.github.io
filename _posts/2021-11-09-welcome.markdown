On this site I will post on various topics and opinions, it is possible that after a while I will come back here and realize that my opinions and beliefs have changed (as natural as life). So don't take something too seriously if it bothers you and move on.

At the moment I am interested in learning some algebra and math once and for all, so I have installed MathJax support in Jekyll.

$$E=mc^2$$

I will update as I solve _basic_ problems and thus I will learn to write in latex at the same time that I learn something new.

By the way, my native language is not English, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes made.
